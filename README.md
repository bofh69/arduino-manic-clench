A simple game for the Elegoo UNO R3 board.
Stay in the middle of the walls for as long as possible.

## TODO

* Loot crates
* Micro transactions
* Some online servers you need to login to even if not playing online
* Required updates every time you try to start the game.

## Hardware
* An LCD 1602 module (see the LCD display example for how to connect it, except the panel's D7 is connected to the UNO's digital 7 pin).
* An analog joystick module. +5V to 5V, GND to GND, SW to the UNO's digital pin 6. VRx to A0, VRy to A1 (or vice versa).
* A passive buzzer. - to GND, + to UNO's digital pin 2.

I got the modules from the Elegoo UNO R3 Super Starter Kit.
